# MenuApp

MenuApp is a simple Flutter app Iâ€™m making to practice and learn.  
The idea of the app is to show menus
throught the course
## âœ¨ What the app does

- Shows a menu screen  
- Lets you navigate between pages  
- Displays items in a simple layout  
- Has some placeholder content to test the desig
- 
 ðŸ“¦ What it already has

- Flutter project setup (works on Android/iOS)  
- Basic navigation between screens  
- Simple UI with some test menu items  
- Project structure ready for more features
- ## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s next

I will update it soon with:

- Real menu data instead of placeholders  
- Better UI design and styling  
- Extra features like categories, favorites, maybe search  
- More interactivity for users
